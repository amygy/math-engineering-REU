### Overview
This repository contains work from my Mathematics project completed as part of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) in Complex Systems program held in Dallas, Texas.

Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) are paid summer research programs funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), where undergraduate students collaborate with faculty mentors on research projects.

This project focuses on mathematical modeling of Chagas disease using an extended SIR-type epidemiological model combined with Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to discover governing equations from data.

### Project Description
Due to time constraints and data cleaning requirements, we simulated data resembling the dynamics of Chagas disease rather than using real-world datasets. The project spanned five weeks, during which we developed the model, ran simulations, and applied Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to analyze the data.

While SINDy did not produce the expected results on the Chagas disease simulation, we backtracked and applied a simpler SIS model to simulated Gonorrhea data, which successfully demonstrated the method’s potential.

Given more time, we would have explored multiple models rather than focusing on a single large model, which could improve accuracy and insights into disease dynamics.
